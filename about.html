	<h3>About OutrightWings</h3>
    <p> OutrightWings is a senior computer science student at the University of Idaho. She loves to code all sorts of projects in her freetime from Minecraft mods, to simple computer automation, to 3DS homebrew. She hopes to use her degree to work with robotic systems.

	<p>OutrightWings has always had a love of logic going to a stem school as a child. Always facinated by science and math edutainment on Youtube, turning to code was an inevitability for her. Her father and teachers always deeply encouraged her acedemic goals and she wouldn't be where she is today without that encouragment.</p>
